# DODGE MANIA GAME
**Built using JavaScript and some HTML and CSS for inputs and styling. There is a window.requestAnimationFrame() method that plays a major role in the game animation. It tells the browser that you wish to perform an animation and requests that the browser calls a specified function to update an animation before the next repaint. All these make it a fascinating car dodge game that allows the player to dodge other cars upon game start and reach higher scores.**
